# Arduino-Firebase Control

This application is designed to control an Arduino board based on commands received from a Firebase database. It utilizes the FireSharp package for establishing a connection with Firebase and reading/writing data. In addition, the System.IO.Ports package is used to establish a serial connection with the Arduino board.

## Dependencies

To run this application, the following dependencies are required:

- FireSharp: A package for working with Firebase in .NET applications.
- System.IO.Ports: A package for serial communication with the Arduino board.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed in your project.
2. Establish a connection with your Firebase database using appropriate configuration settings.
3. Read commands from the Firebase database and interpret them as instructions for controlling the Arduino board.
4. Use the System.IO.Ports package to establish a serial connection with the Arduino board and send the corresponding commands.
5. Monitor the Arduino board's response and handle any errors or exceptions that may occur.

Please refer to the code documentation and comments for more detailed information on how the application works and how to customize it for your specific use case.

## Notes

- It is important to properly configure the Firebase connection settings (credentials, database URL, etc.) for successful communication.
- Ensure that the Arduino board is properly connected to the computer and that the correct serial port is selected in the application.
